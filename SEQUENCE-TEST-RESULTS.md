# New Schedule Analysis - Sequence Preservation Test

## Assignment 1 (First Talk) Sequence:

**Week 1:** Steve Ouma
**Week 2:** Cosmas Were  
**Week 3:** Caleb Onyango
**Week 4:** Cosmas Were ‚ö†Ô∏è
**Week 5:** Caleb Onyango ‚ö†Ô∏è
**Week 6:** Steve Ouma
**Week 7:** Cosmas Were ‚ö†Ô∏è
**Week 8:** Austin Ngode ‚úÖ
**Week 9:** Caleb Onyango ‚ö†Ô∏è

### Pattern Analysis:
- Steve: weeks 1, 6 (5-week gap) ‚úÖ
- Cosmas: weeks 2, 4, 7 (2-week, 3-week gaps) ‚ö†Ô∏è
- Caleb: weeks 3, 5, 9 (2-week, 4-week gaps) ‚ö†Ô∏è
- Austin: week 8 only ‚úÖ

**Status:** Still showing clustering! Cosmas appears 3 times, Austin only once.

## Puonjruok Muma (Assignment 8) Sequence:

**Week 1:** Pius Omondi
**Week 2:** James Otieno
**Week 3:** Austin Ngode
**Week 4:** Tom Oyoo
**Week 5:** Pius Omondi
**Week 6:** James Otieno
**Week 7:** Austin Ngode
**Week 8:** Steve Ouma
**Week 9:** Tom Oyoo

### Pattern Analysis:
- Pius: weeks 1, 5 (4-week gap) ‚úÖ
- James: weeks 2, 6 (4-week gap) ‚úÖ
- Austin: weeks 3, 7 (4-week gap) ‚úÖ
- Tom: weeks 4, 9 (5-week gap) ‚úÖ
- Steve: week 8 only ‚úÖ

**Status:** PERFECT SEQUENCE! üéØ 
Pattern: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, then back to 1, 2, 3, 4

## Comparison:

### Puonjruok Muma: ‚úÖ EXCELLENT
- Perfect rotation sequence maintained
- Even spacing (4-5 weeks between repeats)
- All 5 people used fairly

### Assignment 1: ‚ö†Ô∏è STILL PROBLEMATIC
- Sequence is NOT being preserved
- Clustering: Cosmas and Caleb appear too frequently
- Austin barely appears

---

## Why the Difference?

**Puonjruok Muma (Priority 2):**
- Assigned EARLY in priority order
- People available because they don't have conflicting high-priority assignments yet
- Sequence flows naturally

**Assignment 1 (Priority 5):**
- Assigned LATER in priority order
- By this time, people already have Chairman (Priority 1), Puonjruok (Priority 2), Ngimawa (Priority 3)
- Austin gets blocked by his other assignments
- Algorithm keeps picking Cosmas/Caleb because they're "available"

---

## The Root Cause:

The "first pass" logic I added is NOT working as intended for Assignment 1 because by the time it processes Assignment 1:
- Austin already has Chairman or Puonjruok assigned
- The algorithm says "Austin is busy, skip to next in sequence"
- But it's doing this EVERY week Austin is busy
- So Cosmas/Caleb keep getting picked multiple times

---

## Solution Needed:

When Austin is skipped due to high-priority conflict, we need to **track that he's "owed" an Assignment 1** and give it to him in a later week where he's free, even if that breaks the immediate sequence slightly.

OR: We need to look AHEAD and see "Austin will be busy weeks 2, 3, 5, 7" and adjust the entire sequence to avoid those weeks for him.
