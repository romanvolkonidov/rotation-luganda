## Analysis:

**YES! Austin is blocked by higher priority assignments:**

- Week 2: Chairman (Priority 1) + Assignment 2 (Priority 6) → Can't get Assignment 1
- Week 3: Puonjruok Muma (Priority 2) → Can't get Assignment 1
- Week 5: Chairman (Priority 1) → Can't get Assignment 1
- Week 7: Puonjruok Muma (Priority 2) → Can't get Assignment 1

**Austin only gets Assignment 1 in Week 8 when he has no higher priority assignments.**

## Comparison with Cosmas Were:

**Cosmas Were's assignments:**

Week 2: Assignment 1 ✅
Week 4: Assignment 1 ✅ + Assignment 2
Week 6: Assignment 2 only
Week 7: Assignment 1 ✅

**Cosmas is NOT being blocked by higher priority assignments!**

He appears 3 times in Assignment 1 because:
1. He's not in Chairman list (Priority 1)
2. He's not in Puonjruok Muma list (Priority 2)
3. He's available more often than Austin

---

## The Real Problem:

The algorithm is working CORRECTLY! Austin is getting higher priority assignments (Chairman, Puonjruok Muma) which block him from Assignment 1.

---

## Solutions:

### Option 1: Add more people to Assignment 1 list
Add brothers who are NOT in higher priority lists like Chairman or Puonjruok Muma.

### Option 2: Allow multiple assignments per week
Change the algorithm to allow someone to have Chairman + Assignment 1 in the same week (currently blocked).

### Option 3: Balance across all assignments
The algorithm should consider Austin's TOTAL workload (Chairman + Puonjruok + Assignment 1) and give Cosmas more high-priority assignments to balance it out.

### Option 4: Priority rotation adjustment
Lower the priority of repeat assignments. If Cosmas already did Assignment 1 twice, he should be skipped in favor of Austin even if Austin is busy that week.

---

## My Recommendation:

**Option 3: Balance total workload** - The fairest approach is to count ALL assignments across all priorities and ensure everyone has similar total workload, not just balance within each individual list.

Would you like me to implement this?
