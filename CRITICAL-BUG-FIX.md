# CRITICAL BUG FIX: Schedule History Deletion

## üö® Critical Issue Found and Fixed

### What Happened:
Your 2 saved schedules were **DELETED** when participant lists were edited.

### Root Cause:
In `/src/components/MeetingScheduler.jsx` at **line 1662-1667**, the auto-save function for participant lists was **NOT including `scheduleHistory`** in the data being saved to Firebase.

### The Bug (BEFORE):
```javascript
// Line 1662 - BUGGY CODE
const data = {
  weeks,
  participantLists: updatedLists,
  previousAssignments,
  savedAt: new Date().toISOString()
  // ‚ùå scheduleHistory MISSING!
  // ‚ùå rotationIndices MISSING!
};
```

### The Fix (AFTER):
```javascript
// Line 1662 - FIXED CODE
const data = {
  weeks,
  participantLists: updatedLists,
  previousAssignments,
  scheduleHistory,        // ‚úÖ ADDED - Prevents deletion
  rotationIndices,        // ‚úÖ ADDED - Preserves rotation state
  savedAt: new Date().toISOString()
};
```

## Why This Deleted Your Schedules:

1. You had 2 schedules saved in Firebase
2. This morning you edited a participant list (e.g., added/removed someone)
3. The auto-save triggered
4. It saved ONLY `participantLists`, `weeks`, and `previousAssignments`
5. **Firebase was overwritten WITHOUT `scheduleHistory`**
6. Your 2 saved schedules were permanently deleted

## Data Loss:

**Unfortunately, the 2 schedules are permanently lost** unless you have:
- A backup of the Firebase database
- The schedules saved somewhere else
- Browser localStorage (unlikely)

## Prevention:

‚úÖ **Fixed**: The bug is now fixed. Future participant list edits will preserve scheduleHistory.

‚úÖ **Recommendation**: Export/backup your schedules regularly until this codebase is fully tested.

## Other Save Functions Checked:

‚úÖ Line 240-249: Schedule save - Includes scheduleHistory ‚úì
‚úÖ Line 3230: Delete schedule - Includes scheduleHistory ‚úì  
‚úÖ Line 3332: Update schedule - Includes scheduleHistory ‚úì

**Only the participant list auto-save (line 1662) had this bug.**

## Testing the Fix:

1. Restart your app: `npm run dev`
2. Create a test schedule and save it to history
3. Edit a participant list (add/remove someone)
4. Check browser console - should see: `‚úÖ Participant lists auto-saved to Firebase`
5. Click "History" button - your test schedule should still be there

## Status:

üî¥ **Data Loss**: 2 schedules deleted (cannot be recovered without backup)
‚úÖ **Bug Fixed**: Future edits will not delete scheduleHistory
‚ö†Ô∏è **Action Needed**: Re-create your schedules or restore from backup if available
